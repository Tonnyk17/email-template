## Hello friend 

This project is divided into 2 parts: 

In the first part you will find the static design of an email in HTML (it is in the `master` branch) 

In the second part you will find a fragment of the design but made dynamically, 
there is also the file to add dynamism with Jinja (it is in the `jinja-template` branch)
